# emoging

## Getting Started
1. ```git clone https://github.com/parshnt/emoging.git```
2. ```cd emoging```
3. ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
4. ```python main.py ```

## NOTE

- The original project was deployed as an API, for serving remote IoT devices.
- Due to limitations in API consumption, I've rewritten the project to run on end-user systems.
- This is a demonstration of emotion recognition capability build into the original project without the API.
- Due to the GitHub upload size limit, the trained modal has a lower size & accuracy compared to the original one.
